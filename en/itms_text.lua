<h2 c=ty>Weapon Categories</h2>
Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).


<c=ty b>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons: </c><z>Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. </z>Characters of <z>other</z>most classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.


<c=ty b>Melee and Ranged Weapons: </c>Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

<c=ty>Reach Weapons: </c>Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to him or her. Most reach double the wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away<z>, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away</z>.

<c=ty>Double Weapons: </c>Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

<c=ty>Thrown Weapons: </c>Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons<z> (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn’t have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet</z>.

<c=ty>Projectile Weapons: </c>Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.

<c=ty>Ammunition: </c>Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings).<z> When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading.</z> Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them after they are thrown.


<c=ty b>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons: </c>This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

<c=ty>Light: </c>A light weapon is easier to use in one’s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder’s Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder’s primary hand only.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.

<c=ty>One-Handed: </c>A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his or her Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.

<c=ty>Two-Handed: </c>Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon. 


<c=ty b>Weapon Size: </c>Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.<z>

A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

Inappropriately Sized Weapons: A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.

The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.


Improvised Weapons: Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</z>


<h2 c=ty>Weapon Qualities</h2>
The weapon you use says something about who you are. You probably want to equip with both a melee weapon and a ranged weapon. If you can’t afford both of them, decide which is more important to you.

What size of weapon you choose determines how you can choose to wield it (with one hand or two) and how much damage you can deal with it. A two-handed weapon deals more damage than a one-handed weapon, but wielding a two-handed weapon prevents the wielder from using a shield, so that’s a trade-off.

The number of weapons you are proficient with depends on your class and race. You can also become proficient with additional weapons by selecting the right feats.

A better weapon is usually more expensive than an inferior one, but more expensive doesn’t always mean better. For instance, a rapier is more expensive than a longsword. For a dexterous rogue with the Weapon Finesse feat, a rapier is a terrific weapon. For a typical fighter, a longsword is better.


You need to consider the following qualities when choose weapons:

<b c=ty>Cost:</b> This value is the weapon’s cost in gold pieces (gp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.


<b c=ty>Damage:</b> The damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit.


<b c=ty>Damage Type:</b> Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.

In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon (choose the best automatically in game).


<b c=ty>Critical:</b> When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.

<b>Exception:</b> Extra damage over and above a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.

For example:
5%/x2(or x2): The weapon scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit.
10%/x3(or 19-20/x3): The weapon scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals triple damage on a critical hit.


<b c=ty>Weight:</b> The weight of the weapon.


<b c=ty>Special:</b> Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details.


Small creatures use Small weapons, lower damage, halved weight;
Large creatures use Large weapons, higher damage, doubled weight.]]

<h2 c=ty>Armor Qualities</h2>
To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.


You need to consider the following qualities when choose armor or shields:

<b c=ty>Cost:</b> The price of the armor.


<b c=ty>Armor/Shield Bonus:</b> Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other items that grant a shield bonus.


<b c=ty>Maximum Dex Bonus:</b> This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.

Your character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his or her Armor Class.

<b>Shields:</b> Shields do not affect a character’s maximum Dexterity bonus, except for tower shields.


<b c=ty>Armor Check Penalty:</b> A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor’s (and/or shield’s) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on Reflex checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.

A character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.

<b>Shields:</b> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.


<b c=ty>Arcane Spell Failure Chance:</b> Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they’re wearing armor.

<b>Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor:</b> A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure roll. The Arcane Spell Failure Chance of Armor and Shields is the chance that the spell fails and is ruined.

<b>Shields:</b> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.


<b c=ty>Speed:</b> Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. 

<b>Shields:</b> Shields do not affect a character’s speed.


<b c=ty>Weight:</b> The weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.]]

The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.

<h2 c=ty>Size and Magic Items</h2>
Most of the time, the size of a magic item shouldn't be an issue. Many magic items are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer. As a rule, size should not keep overweight characters, characters of various genders, or characters of various kinds from using magic items.


<h2 c=ty>Magic Items on the Body</h2>
Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It's possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as eleven magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body.


A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which place on the body the item is worn.

- One headband, hat, or helmet on the head
- One amulet, necklace, or periapt around the neck
- One robe or suit of armor on the body
- One belt around the waist (over a robe or suit of armor)
- One cloak, cape, or mantle around the shoulders (over a robe or suit of armor)
- One pair of gloves, gauntlets, bracers or bracelets on the hands, arms or wrists
- One ring on each hand (or two rings on one hand)
- One pair of boots or shoes on the feet
- two additional accessories


Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. He can have a pouch full of magic rings, for example. But he can only benefit from two rings at a time. If he puts on a third ring, it doesn't work.

This general rule applies to other attempts to "double up" on magic items - for instance, if a character puts on another magic cloak on top of one he is already wearing, the second cloak's power does not work.]]
