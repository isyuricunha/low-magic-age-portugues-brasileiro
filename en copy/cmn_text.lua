s_abis_n="Abilities"	s_abis_a="ABIS"	s_abis_d=[[Your character has six abilities: Strength (abbreviated Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha).

Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his or her actions.

Almost every die roll you make is going to be modified based on your character’s abilities.

Each of your character’s above-average abilities gives you a benefit on certain die rolls, and each below-average ability gives you a disadvantage on other die rolls.]]

s_abis_h=s_abis_d.."\n\n\n"..[[<h3 c=ty>Ability Modifiers</h3>
Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from –5 to +5.

The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability.

You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren’t die rolls.

A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.


<h3 c=ty>Abilities and Spellcasters</h3>
The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your character is:

Intelligence for wizards;

Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers;

or Charisma for sorcerers and bards.

In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a given spell level. (See the class descriptions for details.)


<h3 c=ty>Ability Score Changing</h3>
When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly.

A character does not retroactively get additional skill points for previous levels if she increases her intelligence.]]

str={n="Strength", a="Str", d=[[<c=desc>Strength measures your character’s muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for fighters, barbarians, paladins, rangers, and monks because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount of equipment your character can carry.</c>

<hb c=ty>You apply your character’s Strength modifier to:</hb>
• Melee attack rolls.

• Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (including a sling). (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only one-half the character’s Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive one and a half times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)

• Climb, Jump, and Swim checks. These are the skills that have Strength as their key ability.

• Strength checks<z> (for breaking down doors and the like)</z>.]]}

dex={n="Dexterity", a="Dex", d=[[<c=desc>Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it’s also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (rangers and barbarians) or no armor at all (monks, wizards, and sorcerers), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.</c>

<hb c=ty>You apply your character’s Dexterity modifier to:</hb>
• Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and other ranged weapons.

• Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.

• Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.

• Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Ride, Sleight of Hand, Tumble, and Use Rope checks. These are the skills that have Dexterity as their key ability.]]}

con={n="Constitution", a="Con", d=[[<c=desc>Constitution represents your character’s health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character’s hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.</c>

<hb c=ty>You apply your character’s Constitution modifier to:</hb>
• Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1—that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he or she advances in level).

• Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison and similar threats.

• Concentration checks. Concentration is a skill, important to spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.


If a character’s Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character’s hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.]]}

int={n="Intelligence", a="Int", d=[[<c=desc>Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It’s also important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.</c>

<hb c=ty>You apply your character’s Intelligence modifier to:</hb>
• The number of languages your character knows at the start of the game.

• The number of skill points gained each level. (But your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.)

• Appraise, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Knowledge, Search, and Spellcraft checks. These are the skills that have Intelligence as their key ability.


A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell’s level.

An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3. The behavior patterns and strategies of creatures in combat greatly depend on their natural level of intelligence. Creatures with low intelligence only attack instinctively. Creatures with high intelligence are more tactical.]]}

wis={n="Wisdom", a="Wis", d=[[<c=desc>Wisdom describes a character’s willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one’s ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one’s surroundings. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.</c>

<hb c=ty>You apply your character’s Wisdom modifier to:</hb>
• Will saving throws (for negating the effect of charm person and other spells).

• Heal, Listen, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks. These are the skills that have Wisdom as their key ability.


Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell’s level.]]}

cha={n="Charisma", a="Cha", d=[[<c=desc>Charisma measures a character’s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has a Charisma score.</c>

<hb c=ty>You apply your character’s Charisma modifier to:</hb>
• Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Gather Information, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks. These are the skills that have Charisma as their key ability.

• Checks that represent attempts to influence others.

• Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, vampires, and other undead.


Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell’s level.]]}

The creature applies its full Strength bonus on damage rolls with its primary natural weapons, or 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the creature has only one primary natural weapon (for example, a wolf’s bite).

Attacks with secondary natural weapons are less effective and are made with a –5 penalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes a single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity. A creature applies 1/2 its Strength bonus on damage rolls with its secondary natural weapons.

Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manufactured weapons when they make a full attack. When they do so, the manufactured weapon attack is considered the primary attack unless the creature’s description indicates otherwise and any natural weapons the creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks. These secondary attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they take the usual –5 penalty (or –2 with the Multiattack feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is normally the creature’s primary natural weapon.


<h2 c=ty>Types of Natural Weapons</h2>
Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common are summarized below.

<b>Bite:</b> The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.

<b>Claw or Talon:</b> The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.

<b>Gore:</b> The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.

<b>Slap or Slam:</b> The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.

<b>Sting:</b> The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in addition to hit point damage.

<b>Tentacle:</b> The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.]]

The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.

<b c=tw>Hard Ground: </b>Any surface that doesn’t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).


Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.

+5		Tracked party hides trail (and moves at half speed)

1. For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size category.

2. Apply only the largest modifier from this category.

Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature’s passage using the DCs given above, but you can’t use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal).]]

s_anm_cmp="Animal Companion"

If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid.

This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.

A 1st-level druid’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character’s druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid’s effective level to 0 or lower, she can’t have that animal as a companion.)

<b>Class Level: </b>The character’s druid level. The druid’s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion’s abilities and the alternative lists available to the character.

<b>Bonus HD: </b>Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion’s base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion’s base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal’s HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster’s Hit Dice.

<b>Natural Armor Adj.: </b>The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion’s existing natural armor bonus.

<b>Str/Dex Adj.: </b>Add this value to the animal companion’s Strength and Dexterity scores.

<b>Bonus Tricks: </b>The value given in this column is the total number of “bonus” tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don’t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can’t be changed.]]

Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.

Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands).

The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.

To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature’s Will save against the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.

Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.]]

Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains concealment against that opponent.

Wearing a Blindfold: The opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total concealment against the opponent.

A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a saving throw but can try to avoid this as described above.

Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability.

Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.

s_scent					="Scent"
s_scent_d				=[[This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.]]

s_scent_e				=[[A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.

The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the scent is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.

A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have the scent ability, however, can use it in the water easily.

False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the base Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.]]

s_cover_d				= [[One of the best defenses available is cover. By taking cover behind a tree, a wall, the side of a wagon, or the battlements of a castle, you can protect yourself from attacks, especially ranged attacks, and also from being spotted.

To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).

When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from your square to the target’s square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.

<b c=ty>Cover and Reflex Saves: </b>Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you, such as a breath weapon or a lightning bolt. Note that spread effects, such as a fireball, can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.

<b c=ty>Soft Cover: </b>Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves.

<b c=ty>Superior Cover: </b>Similar to cover, but the target is covered by a larger area and double the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves (to +8 and +4, respectively). Only ranged attacks may suffer superior cover, melee attacks suffer at most cover.

<b c=ty>Total Cover: </b>If you don’t have line of effect to your target (for instance, if he is completely behind a high wall), he is considered to have total cover from you. You can’t make an attack against a target that has total cover.

<b c=ty>Cover and Attacks of Opportunity: </b>You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.]]

Concealment encompasses all circumstances where nothing physically blocks a blow or shot but where something interferes with an attacker’s accuracy. Typically, concealment is provided by a shadowy area, darkness, fog, or magical effects that make it difficult to pinpoint a target’s location.

Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. If the attacker hits, the defender makes a miss chance percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.

<b c=ty>Total Concealment: </b>If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight (for instance, if he is in darkness, or if you’re blinded), he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can’t attack the target, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance. Moreover, you can’t execute an attack of opportunity against the target.

<b c=ty>Ignoring Concealment: </b>Concealment isn’t always effective. A shadowy area or darkness doesn’t provide any concealment against an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a greater distance with the same light source than other characters.]]

<b>Dark: </b>creatures are effectively blinded. Creatures within this area have total concealment.
